# SCOPE OF PROCESS
The company called Vintage Woods has seen an incline in the growth and profit over the years and the reviews about the products 
from the customers show that the company is doing well in the market. Since the company was only selling products online in a B2C
(Business to Customer) fashion, they would like to expand the business and reach more customers with the help of retailers. 
This would constitute the company moving into B2B (Business to Business) domain.
To achieve this, the company needs to incorporate technologies for handling sales, marketing, 
managing inventory, maintaining customer satisfaction, improving the manufacturing process, and streamlining the overall business process. 
For this reason, we as a team of 2 business analyst have implemented a full suite of Business Intelligence and Business Analytics systems to help them bring in retailers, to be able to resolve issues, and streamline the business process. The proposed system design is novel for the following reasons:

## MongoDB: 
Both structured and unstructured data can be handled on-premises as well as in the cloud.
## CRM Integrated with Outlook and Teams: 
The CRM is integrated with Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Teams for ease of communication. 
## Tickets/Cases: 
Issues and complaints are received in the form of cases that can be easily tracked in one place and as well as draw insights from them. 
## Balanced Scorecard: 
We created a solution based on the goals established by a balanced scorecard and measured it using Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and other metrics.
## Interactive Dashboards: 
Interactive dashboards are developed using Tableau to provide visualizations in the form of graphs.
